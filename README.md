## INTRODUCTION
This project is a desktop-focused sign-up form designed to practice form creation and styling techniques using HTML and CSS.

It is part of an assignment that emphasizes structuring forms, styling forms and client side form validation using HTML without requiring server side form validation.

## Features
- Fieldset-based Layout: The form inputs are grouped into two logical fieldsets, each occupying half the width of the parent container.

- Custom Styling: Styled focus and invalid input states for better user feedback.

- Logo Integration: Features a Norse-themed "ODIN" logo styled with a bold font and a complementary background image.

- Background Image Overlay: The left panel has a background image with a dark overlay for improved contrast and readability.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: For the structure of the webpage.
- CSS: For styling, including:
    - Flexbox for layout.
    - Custom Font: Integrated Norse-inspired font for a unique logo design.

## Lessons Learned
- Structuring forms
- Client-side form validation using HTML
- Using fieldsets to group form inputs logically.
- Styling forms and handling pseudo-classes like :focus and :invalid.

## Next Steps
- Explore responsiveness for mobile and tablet devices.
- Implement form validation using JavaScript for improved user experience.
